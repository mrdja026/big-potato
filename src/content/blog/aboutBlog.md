## To Whom It May Concern

## About Me

- ~10 years in the software industry
- Web developer (full-stack, frontend-leaning)

The blog covers **career break**projects, as these are something I wanted to build but did not have time for while working full-time ([read more here](/blog/career-break-ai-projects)).

I'll share:

- Projects I've built, how I built them, and what I learned along the way
- Honest takes (some might be wrong, incomplete, or opinionated, due to skill/knowledge issues)
- Reflections on work, learning, and experimenting with AI

_Disclaimer:_ Everything here represents my own perspective. Advice may not apply to everyone, so take it with a grain of salt.

I'm also experimenting with **SEO** and **reach**, mainly via **LinkedIn distribution**. These couple of blogs are my first attempt at blogging, so it's as much about learning the process as it is about sharing content.

## Tech Stack of the Blog

- **Framework:** Next.js
- **Storage:** Supabase (Markdown posts, media)
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Analytics:** Vercel Edge Functions → Supabase
- **Cost:** ~40 bucks (chat gpt5) - codex, cursor
- **Built with AI:**

- Builder.io → design
    - Cursor (GPT-5) → coding support
    - Codex (GPT-5 medium reasoning) → edits & iteration
